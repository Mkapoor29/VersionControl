# Staging vs. Production

### Development Environments
Every development team prior to releasing their new features or changes needs to verify that the code they do release is not going to cause any issues or bugs. In order to achieve this, they normally set up multiple environments for different ways to test and verify.  A common practice is for teams to have a developer environment, a UAT or QA environment, and a staging environment. The main purpose of this flow is to find any potential issues that may arise due to changes or new features being added to the codebase. The more ways to test the changes the less likely bugs will be introduced.

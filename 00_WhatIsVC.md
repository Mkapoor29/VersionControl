# WHAT IS VERSION CONTROL
Version control is a system that records all changes and modifications to files for tracking purposes. 
Developers also use the term source control or source code management. 
The primary goal of any version control system is to keep track of changes. 
It achieves this by allowing developers access to the entire change history with the ability to revert or roll back to a previous state or point in time. 
There are different types of changes, such as 
* adding new files,
* modifying or updating files,
* and deleting files.
The version control system is the source of truth across all code, assets, and the team itself.

# EXAMPLE 
In word processing applications, version control functionality is available to provide users with the safety net of auto-saving the document. 
The application creates a restoration point on each auto-save to which the user can revert if required.

# BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH VERSION CONTROL
* Revision History -
  * Revision history provides a record of all changes in a project.
  * It provides developers with the ability to revert to a stable point in time in cases where code edits cause issues or bugs.
  * The ability to roll back to a particular version or time allows teams to work faster and deliver code with more confidence. 
* Identity -
  *  Keeping a record of changes is great, but it doesn't have as much value if you don't know who is responsible for adding or changing a record.
  *  All changes made are always recorded with the identity of the user that made them.
  *  Combining this feature with the revision history allows teams to see not only when the changes occurred, but also who made the changes
* Collaboration 
* Automation
* Efficiency
* As a software developer, you will often work with a team to achieve a common goal. This can be adding new features to an existing project or creating a brand new service.
* In all cases, a version control system allows the team to submit their code and keep track of any changes that need to be made.
* Another important aspect of a version control system is something called a peer review.
  * Developers working on a task create a peer review once the code is ready for inspection.
  * The peer review aims to get other developers on your team to review the code and provide feedback where necessary.
  

The ability to create and deliver code on a wide scale is complex and time-consuming. 
Version control helps keep track of all changes.
It plays an integral role in the explosion of development operations, or DevOps, as it's commonly called. 
DevOps is a set of practices, philosophies, and tools that increase an organization's ability to deliver applications or services to a high quality and velocity.
